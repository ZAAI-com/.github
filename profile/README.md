## Welcome to my Code Laboratory ⚡️

**ZAAI** is a collection of [my](https://github.com/manuelgruber/) side projects, experiments, tools, and solutions born from curiosity. Every project here started with a real challenge I faced. Instead of over-engineering, I focus on solving the core problem. What you’ll find here:

- **Prototypes** to showcase and test hypotheses.
- **Utilities** that remove recurring friction from daily work.
- **Templates** that turn blank pages into working scaffolds.
